# Penetration Testing Report

## Target: Astra Security Login Page

### Overview
This report summarizes the findings from the passive analysis of the Astra Security login page. The analysis was conducted to identify potential security issues without performing active testing, in compliance with the bug bounty program's rules.

### Findings

#### 1. Unauthorized API Requests
Several 401 Unauthorized errors were observed in the browser console logs when attempting to load resources from the Astra API endpoints. This indicates that the requests were made without proper authentication, which is expected behavior for protected endpoints.

#### 2. Iframe Sandbox Attribute
A warning was observed in the browser console logs regarding an iframe that has both `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` for its sandbox attribute. This configuration can potentially escape its sandboxing and may pose a security risk.

#### 3. Deprecated Libraries
The browser console logs included a warning that the client application uses libraries for user authentication or authorization that are deprecated. It is recommended to update the application to use the latest libraries as per the provided migration guide to mitigate potential security risks.

#### 4. Input Elements Autocomplete Attributes
A verbose message in the browser console logs suggested that input elements should have autocomplete attributes, specifically "current-password" for the password field. This is a best practice for improving user experience and security.

#### 5. HTTP Headers
The HTTP headers of the Astra website were inspected using a curl command. The headers included security-related directives such as `x-frame-options`, `referrer-policy`, `strict-transport-security`, and `x-content-type-options`. These headers are configured to enhance the security of the website.

### Recommendations
1. **Review Iframe Sandbox Configuration**: Investigate the iframe sandbox attribute configuration and consider removing either `allow-scripts` or `allow-same-origin` to prevent potential sandbox escape vulnerabilities.
2. **Update Deprecated Libraries**: Follow the migration guide to update the client application to use the latest libraries for user authentication or authorization.
3. **Add Autocomplete Attributes**: Add autocomplete attributes to input elements, especially for sensitive fields like passwords, to improve user experience and security.
4. **Continue Passive Analysis**: Further passive analysis of the website's client-side code and content is recommended to identify additional potential security issues.

### Conclusion
The passive analysis of the Astra Security login page identified several areas for improvement in terms of security best practices. By addressing the recommendations outlined in this report, the security posture of the website can be enhanced.
